/*Write a program that asks for the number of calories and fat grams in a food. The program
should display the percentage of calories that come from fat. If the calories from fat are less
than 30% of the total calories of the food, it should also display a message indicating that the
food is low in fat. One gram of fat has 9 calories, so Calories from fat = fat grams * 9. The
percentage of calories from fat can be calculated as: calories from fat/total calories
Input validation: Make sure the number of calories and fat grams are not less than 0. Also, the
number of calories from fat cannot be greater than the total number of calories. If that happens,
display an error message indicating that either the calories or fat grams were incorrectly entered.*/

    printf("Enter number of calories and fat grams in a food");
