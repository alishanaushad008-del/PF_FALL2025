/*Teacher asks the student to check whether the input number is divisible by 7 or not. For checking
the divisibility, take the last digit and double it, take the rest of the digits and subtract the
doubled last digit repeat until the result is 7, -7 or 0. For example:
10976 -> 1097-12 = 1085 -> 108-10 = 98 -> 9-16 = -7
49 -> 4 - 18 = 14 -> 1 - 8 = -7*/
